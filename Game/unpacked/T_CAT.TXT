METAMORF The Morphing Graphics Utility

Morphing is one of Hollywood's hottest 
special effects--you've seen it in TV
commercials, music videos, and movies.  
The effect is mesmerizing, creating the
smooth transition of one image to 
another.  With METAMORF, you can 
quickly create this amazing technique 
on your own personal computer.  Simply
load in any two images, identify key 
corresponding points (such as eyes, 
nose, and mouth), choose the number of 
frames, and let METAMORF work its 
magic.  Then play back the results.  
For fun or professional use.
