Explore the underwater caverns in 
search of Dr. Riptide's undersea lab.

Keys/Buttons used:
        
        Arrow keys for direction.

        Space bar or button 1 to 
        fire.

        Ctrl, Alt, or button 2 to 
        enter caves or to control
        JASON sub.

        ESC for options.

        F10 for quick exit to DOS.


Your ability can be enhanced by 
collecting Power-Ups.  Here is a
summary of a few of the Power-Ups
available:

         Shield Power-Up adds to 
         your shield but decreases
         fire power.

         Auto fire Power-Up makes
         your guns fire rapidly.

         Fire Power-Up gives you
         more powerful missiles.

         JASON submersible follows
         player.


To enter the JASON submersible, use
Ctrl, Alt or button 2 of the joystick.
JASON can shoot small projectiles and 
collect coins only.  The small size 
of JASON will be very useful in some 
situations!

Scores for goodies are doubled if
you get them while they are still in
motion.

Bonus points are awarded at the end
of the round for remaining air and
shield.













    Dr. Riptide awaits your arrival!  

      Good Luck, S.N.A.T. 1138...
