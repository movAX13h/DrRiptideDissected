[1]  Game play problems
-----------------------

Q.  Sometimes the JASON sub goes out of control and does not follow me.

A.  If the main sub is hit, JASON may malfunction.


Q.  How can I turn the sound off while playing the game?

A.  You can always press ESC to get the options screen.


Q.  Sometimes I want to enter a cave but the game does not let me.

A.  Some caves cannot be entered because they are inhabited with large 
    creatures!


Q.  How do I use the Pulse Cannon?

A.  First you must find all the pieces to assemble the cannon.  Once you
    have done that, you get 50 shots of incredible fire power!


Q.  The game does not speed up when I put game speed on 'FAST'.

A.  On older machines the game can only speed up so much.  This game is 
    recommended for 386-33 or faster.

Tip: If you are finding a level too hard to complete, try setting the
     game speed to 'SLOW'.


[2]  Technical problems  
-----------------------

Q.  I have a mouse but the cursor does not respond to it.

A.  Make sure your mouse driver is loaded before starting Riptide.


Q.  When I use the arrow keys that are not on the number pad, I can't 
    always control the sub.

A.  This is a hardware bug with some MSDOS PCs.  Try to use the arrow
    keys on the number pad.


Q.  My sound card crashes Riptide before it can load.

A.  If you are experiencing difficulties with digital sound, you can force
    Riptide to load with PC speaker sound by using the -pcsound command line 
    option.  At the command prompt type:  RIPTIDE -PCSOUND
