[2]  The Story
--------------
You are Nick Nautilus, Special Naval AgenT (SNAT) 1138!  

SNAT 1138 Mission Summary:

You have been called into action to seek and destroy the undersea laboratory of
Dr. Tiberius Riptide, a mad scientific outcast.  You have been ordered to use 
any means necessary to put Dr. Riptide and his secret lab out of comission...
for good.  A JASON submersible will be issued to aid your search.  The JASON's
small, manageble size will make it an invaluable asset.

Mission Background:

Riptide was banished from the scientific community after he announced plans to
construct devices of heinous mass destruction to the population of the world's
oceans. Intelligence has reported that Riptide has finally developed his Tuna-
Matic, a device that turns living matter into a marketable delicacy.  Riptide 
is fast becoming a rich villian by selling his "Tuna" on the black market as a
trendy food for the filthy rich and powerful.  Riptide has hidden himself deep
within underwater catacombs off the coast of Australia and has surrounded him-
self with deadly protection.  You will come face to face with many of Dr. Rip-
tide's creations and traps so be prepared.  If you reach his lab, Riptide will
be waiting for you, and he will have no regrets shipping you out in a tuna can.

Good luck, SNAT 1138...You'll need it.

[3]  Game play problems
-----------------------
Q.  Why does my gun power reduce sometimes?

A.  When you collect SHIELD power-ups it reduces your fire-power.  More
    advanced players will only collect shield power-ups when absolutely
    neccessary. 


Q.  Why does the JASON sub go out of control and not follow me sometimes?

A.  If the main sub is damaged, JASON may malfunction.


Q.  How can I turn the sound off while playing the game?

A.  You can always press ESC to get the options screen.


Q.  Sometimes I want to enter a cave but the game does not let me.

A.  Some caves cannot be entered because they are inhabited with large 
    creatures!


Q.  How do I use the Pulse Cannon?

A.  First you must find all the pieces to assemble the cannon.  Once you
    have done that, you get 50 shots of incredible fire power!


Q.  The game does not speed up when I put game speed on 'FAST'.

A.  On older machines the game can only speed up so much.  This game is 
    recommended for 386-33 or faster.

Tip: If you are finding a level too hard to complete, try setting the
     game speed to 'SLOW'.


[4]  Technical problems  
-----------------------
Q.  I have a mouse but the cursor does not respond to it.

A.  Make sure your mouse driver is loaded before starting Riptide.


Q.  When I use the arrow keys that are not on the number pad, I can't 
    always control the sub.

A.  This is a hardware bug with some MSDOS PCs.  Try to use the arrow
    keys on the number pad.


Q.  My sound card crashes Riptide before it can load.

A.  If you are experiencing difficulties with digital sound, you can force
    Riptide to load with PC speaker sound by using the -pcsound command line 
    option.  At the command prompt type:  RIPTIDE -PCSOUND
